so what im thinking of doing is implementing a database to store the chat first, post using POST into the database and create an entity of chat which stores data #DONE

Once that is done, set up SPRING SECURITY and use JWT tokens and OAuth2 for authentication using spring security.

Make chats user specific

Enable file uploads and context summarization #DONE

try a similar approach in graphQL

Once that is done, add the ability to create multiple chats per user?

+ Add microservices
